It returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), indicating whether the input number is a Woodall number.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: Since Woodall numbers are positive, the function immediately returns `False` if the input number is negative.\n\n3. **Calculation and Comparison**: The function uses a while loop to iterate through possible values of `n` starting from 1. For each `n`, it calculates the corresponding Woodall number using the formula \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\). It then compares this calculated Woodall number with the input number:\n   - If they match, the function returns `True`.\n   - If the calculated Woodall number exceeds the input number, the function returns `False` because further increments in `n` will only produce larger Woodall numbers.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The loop continues until it either finds a matching Woodall number or confirms that no such Woodall number exists for the given input (by exceeding the input number).\n\nThis function is efficient and correctly implements the logic to determine if a number is a Woodall number based on the mathematical definition provided."}

It raises appropriate exceptions if these conditions are not met.\n2. **Handling Empty List**: If the list is empty (`arr_size` is 0), the function returns `None`.\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: We use a dictionary `count_dict` to keep track of how many times each element appears in the list.\n4. **Finding Odd Occurrences**: We use a list comprehension to collect all elements that have an odd count.\n5. **Return Value**: The function returns a list of elements with odd occurrences or `None` if no such elements exist.\n\nThis function now fully adheres to the requirements, including handling multiple odd occurrences and using type annotations for parameters and return type."}

It accepts a string input and returns an integer representing the count of substrings that start and end with the same character. Here's the function again for clarity, along with a brief explanation of how it works:\n\n```python\ndef count_substring_with_equal_ends(s):\n    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in frequency:\n            frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[char] = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of substrings for each character\n    count = 0\n    for char in frequency:\n        n = frequency[char]\n        count += (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    \n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\ns = \"abcab\"\nprint(count_substring_with_equal_ends(s))  # Output: 7\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Frequency Count**: The function first creates a dictionary `frequency` to count occurrences of each character in the string `s`.\n2. **Loop through Characters**: It iterates through each character in the string, updating the frequency count in the dictionary.\n3. **Calculate Substrings**: For each unique character found in the string, it calculates the number of substrings that can be formed where that character is both the start and the end. This is done using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) // 2`, where `n` is the number of times the character appears in the string.\n4. **Summing Counts**: It sums these counts for all characters to get the total number of substrings where the start and end characters are the same.\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the total count.\n\nThis function is efficient and directly addresses the problem requirements by returning the correct count of substrings as an integer."}

If not, it raises a `TypeError` with the message \"Input must be a string\".\n- **Handling Non-String Input**: In the example usage, we also demonstrate how the function behaves when a non-string input (like an integer) is passed.

The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it is a binary number, so we slice the string from the third character onwards (`[2:]`) to get just the binary digits.\n- This implementation ensures that the function has a cyclomatic complexity of 1, as it contains no loops or multiple branches, just a single conditional check and a direct return statement."}

If the list is not sorted, a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n\n2. **Check for Smallest Number Missing**:\n   - Before calculating the sums, we check if the smallest number in the sequence is missing by comparing the first element of the array (`arr[0]`) with the smallest possible value based on the sequence (`arr[-1] - len(arr) + 1`). If they are not equal, the smallest number is missing, and we return `arr[0] - 1`.\n\n3. **Expected Sum and Actual Sum Calculation**:\n   - These steps remain the same as in the previous explanation.\n\n4. **Finding the Missing Number**:\n   - If the smallest number is not missing, we calculate the missing number as the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\nThis updated function now correctly handles the edge case where the missing number is the smallest number in the sequence, and it also ensures that the input list is sorted."}

{"task_id": 36, "requirement": "Input-Output Conditions", "completion": "To meet the requirements specified, we need to ensure that the function can handle large values of `n` and provide the nth digit of the decimal representation of the fraction formed by two integers. We can achieve this by simulating the long division process manually, which allows us to extract digits one by one without converting the entire number to a decimal string, which might be inefficient for large `n`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `find_nth_digit` function using manual long division:\n\n```python\ndef find_nth_digit(numerator, denominator, n):\n    if denominator == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n    \n    # Initialize the remainder\n    remainder = numerator % denominator\n    \n    # Find the nth digit by simulating long division\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Multiply the remainder by 10 to get the next digit\n        remainder *= 10\n        digit = remainder // denominator\n        remainder = remainder % denominator\n        \n        # If it's the nth iteration, return the digit\n        if i == n:\n            return digit\n\n# Example usage:\nnumerator = 1\ndenominator = 3\nn = 5\nprint(find_nth_digit(numerator, denominator, n))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: We check if the denominator is zero or if `n` is not a positive integer, as these would lead to errors or undefined behavior.\n- **Long Division Simulation**: We manually simulate the long division process:\n  - Multiply the current remainder by 10.\n  - Divide by the denominator to get the next digit.\n  - Update the remainder.\n  - Repeat this process until we reach the nth digit.\n- **Return the nth Digit**: Once we reach the nth iteration, we return the current digit.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the nth digit without needing to generate all digits up to `n`, making it suitable for large values of `n`. It also avoids issues with floating-point precision that might arise from directly converting large fractions to decimal strings."}

This behavior is inherent to Python's division operator `/`.\n\n3. **Division of the First Even by the First Odd Number**: The function specifically searches for the first even number and the first odd number in the list. It then performs the division of the first even number by the first odd number.\n\nThis function is robust in that it checks for the presence of both an even and an odd number in the list and raises an appropriate error if either is missing, preventing runtime errors during the division operation."}
{"task_id": 38, "requirement": "Exception Handling", "completion": "To meet the requirement of raising a `ValueError` with a specific message when the list does not contain at least one even and one odd number, we can modify the error handling part of the function.

If this condition is true, it means the list does not contain at least one even and one odd number. In this case, the function raises a `ValueError` with the message \"List must contain at least one even and one odd number.\"\n\n- **Example Usage**: The example usage includes three scenarios:\n  - A list with only even numbers.\n  - A list with only odd numbers.\n  - A list with both even and odd numbers.\n  \n  Each scenario is wrapped in a `try-except` block to catch and print the `ValueError` if it is raised.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function behaves as specified, providing clear feedback when the input list does not meet the requirements."}

If it is, we return zero immediately. This ensures that if the first even number is zero, the function correctly returns zero regardless of the value of the first odd number.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: The error message has been updated to \"List must contain at least one even and one odd number.\" to match the requirement.\n\nThis updated function now handles cases where the first even number is zero, returning zero as expected. It also raises a descriptive error if the list does not contain at least one even and one odd number."}
