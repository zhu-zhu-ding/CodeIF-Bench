If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n2. **Pattern Matching**: The regular expression `[a-z][^a-z]*` is used to find segments of the string starting with a lowercase letter followed by any number of non-lowercase characters.\n3. **Empty List Handling**: After finding the matches, the function checks if the result is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned.\n\nNow, the function will correctly return an empty list if the input string contains no lowercase letters."}

{"task_id": 22, "requirement": "Functionality Extension", "completion": "To modify the `find_first_duplicate` function to return a list of all duplicate elements in the order they first appear, we can use two sets:\n\n1. One set to track all elements that have been seen.\n2. Another set to track only the elements that have been duplicated.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef find_all_duplicates(nums: list) -> list:\n    # Type annotations for parameters and return type\n    \n    if not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in nums):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list of integers\")\n    \n    seen = set()\n    duplicates = set()\n    result = []\n    \n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            if num not in duplicates:\n                duplicates.add(num)\n                result.append(num)\n        else:\n            seen.add(num)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3]\nduplicates = find_all_duplicates(my_array)\nprint(duplicates)  # Output: [2, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`seen`**: Tracks all elements that have been encountered.\n- **`duplicates`**: Tracks elements that have been repeated.\n- **`result`**: Stores the final list of first occurrences of duplicates.\n\nAs the function goes through the list, if an element is found in `seen` but not in `duplicates`, it adds the element to both `duplicates` and `result`. This ensures that each duplicate is added only once to the result list.\n\nFor the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3]`, the output will be `[2, 3]` because these are the first occurrences of the duplicates in the array."}

{"task_id": 29, "requirement": "Functionality Extension", "completion": "To handle cases where multiple elements occur an odd number of times, we need to modify our approach slightly. We'll still use the XOR operation to identify which elements have an odd count, but we'll also group them together to ensure we capture all such elements. \n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef get_odd_occurrences(arr: List[int], arr_size: int) -> List[int]:\n    if not isinstance(arr, list) or not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in arr):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list of integers\")\n    \n    if arr_size != len(arr):\n        raise ValueError(\"arr_size must match the length of the input list\")\n\n    result_mask = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        result_mask ^= num\n    \n    # Find one of the set bits of result_mask\n    rightmost_set_bit = result_mask & -result_mask\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store the results\n    odd_elements = []\n    \n    for num in arr:\n        if num & rightmost_set_bit:\n            odd_elements.append(num)\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each element in odd_elements\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for num in odd_elements:\n        counts[num] += 1\n    \n    # Filter elements that occur an odd number of times\n    final_result = [num for num, count in counts.items() if count % 2 == 1]\n    \n    return final_result\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [2, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 6]\nprint(get_odd_occurrences(arr, len(arr)))  # Output: [6]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input is a list of integers and if the provided `arr_size` matches the actual size of the list. If not, it raises appropriate errors.\n2. **Finding Result Mask**: It calculates `result_mask` using XOR to identify bits that differ among the numbers resulting in an odd count.\n3. **Grouping Elements**: By applying `rightmost_set_bit`, it groups elements into buckets based on whether they share a common bit.\n4. **Counting Occurrences**: It counts the occurrences of elements within these buckets.\n5. **Filtering Odd Counts**: Finally, it filters out elements that occur an odd number of times and returns them.\n\nThis approach ensures that all elements occurring an odd number of times are captured and returned correctly."}

These will hold the first even and first odd numbers found in the list.\n2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through each number in the provided list.\n   - If the current number is even (`num % 2 == 0`) and `first_even` is still `None`, it assigns the current number to `first_even`.\n   - If the current number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`) and `first_odd` is still `None`, it assigns the current number to `first_odd`.\n3. **Break Condition**: Once both `first_even` and `first_odd` are assigned (i.e., they are no longer `None`), the loop breaks to avoid unnecessary iterations.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After the loop, the function checks if both `first_even` and `first_odd` are not `None`.

This allows us to easily get the most frequent character.\n3. **Greedy Placement**: We repeatedly pop the most frequent character from the heap and add it to the result. If there was a previous character that couldn't be placed yet (because it still had remaining occurrences), we push it back into the heap.\n4. **Check Feasibility**: If at any point the heap is empty but there are remaining occurrences of a character, it means it's impossible to rearrange the string to meet the criteria, so we return an empty string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always try to place the most frequent character available, which helps in avoiding adjacent duplicates.

{"task_id": 39, "requirement": "Functionality Extension", "completion": "To extend the function to return all possible valid rearrangements of a string where no two adjacent characters are the same, we need to modify our approach slightly. Instead of stopping after finding one valid rearrangement, we can explore all possible rearrangements using a backtracking approach.

For a rearrangement to be valid, no single character should appear more than `(len(s) + 1) // 2` times. If any character exceeds this limit, it\u2019s impossible to rearrange without having adjacent duplicates.\n   \n3. **Result Collection**:\n   - The `result` list collects all valid rearrangements generated by the backtracking function.\n\nThis implementation ensures that all valid rearrangements are explored and returned.

If it is, the function returns an empty list immediately.\n\n2. **List Comprehension**:\n   - The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `two_d_list`.\n   - It checks if the length of each sublist is greater than the specified `index` (`if len(sublist) > index`). This ensures that it only tries to access indices that exist within each sublist.\n\n3. **Extracting Elements**:\n   - If the index exists, it appends the element at that index to the resulting list.\n\n### Usage Examples:\n- When calling `specified_element([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])`, it will output `[1, 4, 6]`, extracting the first element from each sublist.\n- Calling `specified_element([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]], 1)` will output `[2, 5, 7]`, extracting the second element from each sublist.\n- Calling `specified_element([])` will output an empty list since the input list is empty.\n\nThis function now adheres to all the specified requirements and behaves correctly with various inputs."}

{"task_id": 52, "requirement": "Code Complexity", "completion": "To ensure that the function has a cyclomatic complexity of 1, it means that the function should be straightforward and only contain one path through the code. In Python, this typically involves ensuring that there are no conditional statements (like `if`, `elif`, `else`) inside the function.\n\nGiven these constraints, the simplest way to achieve this is to remove all conditionals from the function. This means that we'll always perform the calculation and return the same result, regardless of the input values for base and height. \n\nHowever, to still meet the requirement of checking for non-negative inputs, we can use assertions.

If they are not, the program will raise an `AssertionError` with the specified message. While this does add some runtime validation, it doesn\u2019t increase the cyclomatic complexity since assertions don\u2019t introduce multiple paths through the code.\n   \n2. **Single Path**: The function body contains a single assignment statement (`return base * height`).
