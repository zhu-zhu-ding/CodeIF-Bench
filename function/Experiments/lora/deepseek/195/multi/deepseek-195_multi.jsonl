The next two calls return `True` and `False` respectively, as expected, because the lists contain duplicates and do not contain duplicates.\n"}

Here's the updated `specified_element` function that raises an `IndexError` with a descriptive message when the specified index is out of range for any sublist:\n\n```python\ndef specified_element(two_dim_list, position=0):\n    if not all(len(row) > position for row in two_dim_list):\n        raise IndexError('Index out of range for sublist')\n    return [row[position] for row in two_dim_list]\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the specified `position` is valid for all sublists in `two_dim_list`. If not, it raises an `IndexError` with the message 'Index out of range for sublist'. If the position is valid, it proceeds to extract the elements as before.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```python\n# Define a two-dimensional list\ntwo_dim_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n# Extract the first element from each row\ntry:\n    print(specified_element(two_dim_list))  # Output: [1, 4, 7]\nexcept IndexError as e:\n    print(e)\n\n# Attempt to extract an element that is out of range for some sublists\ntry:\n    print(specified_element(two_dim_list, 5))  # This will raise an IndexError\nexcept IndexError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nWhen you run the code with the out-of-range index, it will print the custom `IndexError` message:\n\n```\nIndex out of range for sublist\n```\n"}
