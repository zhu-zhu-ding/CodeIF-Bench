The function is named `is_octagonal` to avoid confusion with the built-in Python function `oct()`.\n\nPlease note that the function does not check if a number is octagonal, but rather calculates the nth octagonal number. If you want to check if a number is octagonal, you would need to use a different approach, such as iterating through the octagonal numbers until you find a match or determine that the number is not octagonal.\n", "requirement": "Code Standard"}
