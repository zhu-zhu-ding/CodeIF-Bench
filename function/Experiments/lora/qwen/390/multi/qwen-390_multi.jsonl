When `k` is greater than `n`, the binomial coefficient is 0.\n\nHere's the updated function:\n\n```python\ndef binomial_coeff(n, k):\n    # Edge case: if n is 0 or k is 0, the result is 1\n    if n == 0 or k == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Edge case: if n equals k, the result is 1\n    if n == k:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Edge case: if k is greater than n, the result is 0\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    \n    # If k is more than n-k, then it's more efficient to calculate binomial_coeff(n, n-k)\n    if k > n - k:\n        k = n - k\n    \n    # Initialize result\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Calculate value of [n*(n-1)*---*(n-k+1)] / [k*(k-1)*---*1]\n    for i in range(k):\n        result *= (n - i)\n        result //= (i + 1)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 2))  # Output: 10\nprint(binomial_coeff(10, 3)) # Output: 120\nprint(binomial_coeff(0, 0))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(0, 1))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(1, 0))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(4, 4))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 6))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If `n` is 0 or `k` is 0, the function returns 1 because there is exactly one way to choose 0 elements from any set.\n   - If `n` equals `k`, the function returns 1 because choosing all elements from a set of size `n` is just one way.\n   - If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0 because it's impossible to choose more elements than are available in the set.\n\n2. **Efficiency Check**:\n   - The function checks if `k` is greater than `n-k` and swaps them if true to minimize the number of multiplications.\n\n3. **Multiplicative Formula**:\n   - The function uses the multiplicative formula to compute the binomial coefficient efficiently.\n\nThis updated function now handles all specified edge cases and provides correct results for various inputs."}
{"task_id": 28, "requirement": "Functionality Extension", "completion": "To handle large values of `n` and `k` efficiently, we can use an iterative approach with memoization to store previously computed results. This will help in avoiding redundant calculations and improve performance significantly.\n\nHere's an optimized version of the `binomial_coeff` function using memoization:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef binomial_coeff(n, k):\n    # Base cases\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case using memoized results\n    return binomial_coeff(n - 1, k - 1) + binomial_coeff(n - 1, k)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 2))  # Output: 10\nprint(binomial_coeff(10, 3)) # Output: 120\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Memoization with `lru_cache`**: The `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module is used to cache the results of the `binomial_coeff` function. This means that once a particular combination of `n` and `k` is computed, its result is stored, and subsequent calls with the same parameters will retrieve the result from the cache instead of recomputing it.\n2. **Base Cases**: The base cases are handled explicitly:\n   - \\(\\binom{n}{0} = 1\\) and \\(\\binom{n}{n} = 1\\) for any non-negative integer `n`.\n3. **Recursive Case**: The recursive case uses the relation \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that the function handles large values of `n` and `k` efficiently by leveraging memoization to store and reuse intermediate results."}

The function either returns `True` or `False` based on whether the pattern matches the input string.\n\nThis simplified version ensures that the function remains straightforward and easy to understand while meeting the requirement of having a cyclomatic complexity of 1."}

{"task_id": 60, "requirement": "Functionality Extension", "completion": "To extend the function to handle cases where the difference between adjacent elements can be negative, we need to ensure that we consider both positive and negative differences when constructing the subsequences. However, since the original problem statement mentioned \"difference between adjacent elements,\" I'll assume that the difference can be either positive or negative but always equal to 1.\n\nGiven this assumption, the function remains largely the same as before.

This means that the length of the subsequence ending at `num` is one more than the maximum length of subsequences ending at `num-1` or `num+1`.\n\n4. **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum value from the `dp` dictionary, which gives us the length of the longest subsequence with the required property.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired result using dynamic programming, handling both positive and negative differences between adjacent elements."}
