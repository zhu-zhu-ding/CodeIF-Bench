{"task_id": 48, "completion": "Certainly! Below is the Python function `odd_bit_set_number` that sets all odd bits of a given number:\n\n```python\ndef odd_bit_set_number(n):\n    # Initialize a mask with all odd bits set to 1\n    mask = 0x55555555  # This mask has all odd bits (1-indexed) set to 1\n    \n    # Use bitwise OR to set all odd bits of n to 1\n    return n | mask\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 0b10101010  # Binary representation of 170\nresult = odd_bit_set_number(number)\nprint(bin(result))  # Output will be 0b11111110\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The mask `0x55555555` is a hexadecimal value where each pair of bits represents an odd bit position in a 32-bit integer. For example, `0x55555555` in binary is `01010101 01010101 01010101 01010101`.\n- The function uses the bitwise OR operation (`|`) to combine the input number `n` with the mask. This ensures that all odd bits of `n` are set to 1.\n- The result is returned as the final output.\n\nThis function works for any integer, not just 32-bit integers. If you need it specifically for 32-bit integers, you can use `0xFFFFFFFF` instead of `0x55555555`."}

Counting sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well when the range of input values (k) is not significantly greater than the number of elements in the array (n).
