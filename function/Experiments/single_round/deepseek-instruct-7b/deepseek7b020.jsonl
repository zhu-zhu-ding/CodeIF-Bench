The `int` function is used to convert this binary number to a decimal number. The second argument to the `int` function, `2`, specifies that the input is a binary number. The function then returns the decimal equivalent of the binary number.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(binary_to_decimal('1010'))  # Output: 10\n```\n\nIn this example, the binary number `1010` is converted to the decimal number `10`.\n", "requirement": "Annotation Coverage"}
{"task_id": 24, "completion": "In Python, you can convert a binary number to a decimal number using the built-in function int(). However, if you want to implement the conversion manually, you can do so with a function that uses a for loop to iterate over each digit in the binary number, multiplying the current total by 2 and adding the next digit. Here's an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```python\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary):\n    decimal = 0\n    for digit in binary:\n        decimal = decimal * 2 + int(digit)\n    return decimal\n```\n\nThis function works by starting with a decimal value of 0, then for each digit in the binary number, it multiplies the current total by 2 (effectively shifting the current total one place to the left) and adds the next digit. This is equivalent to converting a binary number to a decimal number.\n\nThe cyclomatic complexity of this function is 2, because there are two possible paths through the code (one for each branch of the for loop). However, since the function always executes the same number of lines of code, and the only decision in the function is whether to multiply by 2 or add the next digit, the cyclomatic complexity can't be reduced to 1 without changing the behavior of the function.\n\nIf you want to ensure that the cyclomatic complexity is 1, you could rewrite the function using a while loop instead of a for loop, but this would also change the behavior of the function, because the for loop automatically stops iterating when it reaches the end of the string, while the while loop would require the caller to manually check whether there are still more digits to process. Here's an example of how you could do this:\n\n```python\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary):\n    decimal = 0\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(binary):\n        decimal = decimal * 2 + int(binary[index])\n        index += 1\n    return decimal\n```\n\nThis function has a cyclomatic complexity of 1, because there is only one path through the code, but it requires the caller to manually manage the index into the binary string, which is not the same as the behavior of the previous for loop.\n", "requirement": "Code Complexity"}

This is necessary because the binomial coefficient is an integer.\n\nAlso, this function uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of `n - i + 1` divided by the factorial of `i`, which is equivalent to calculating the binomial coefficient. The loop runs from 1 to `k`, and in each iteration, it multiplies the current result by `(n - i + 1)` and divides it by `i`.\n\nThis function assumes that the inputs `n` and `k` are non-negative integers.

If they are, then the triangle is equilateral, otherwise it's not.\n\nPlease note that this function does not return anything, it just prints the result. If you want the function to return a boolean value instead of printing, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef check_equilateral(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if a triangle is equilateral or not.\n    It takes three arguments: a, b, c which are the sides of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if all sides are equal\n    return a == b == c\n\n# Test the function\nprint(check_equilateral(3, 3, 3))\nprint(check_equilateral(3, 4, 5))\n```\n\nIn this version, the function returns `True` if the triangle is equilateral and `False` otherwise. You can then use the return value in your code.\n", "requirement": "Code Standard"}
