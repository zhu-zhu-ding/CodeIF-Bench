To solve this task, we'll write a Python function named `count_common` that takes a list of strings (representing words) as input and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple will contain a word and its frequency count, sorted in descending order based on the frequency. If two words have the same frequency, they can be listed in any order.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_common(words: List[str]) -> List[Tuple[str, int]]:\n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    word_counts = Counter(words)\n    \n    # Convert the counter object to a list of tuples and sort it by frequency in descending order\n    sorted_word_counts = sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    return sorted_word_counts\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"banana\"]\nprint(count_common(example_words))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Counter**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each word in the list.\n- **Sorting**: The `sorted` function sorts the items of the counter based on their counts (`item[1]`). The `reverse=True` argument ensures that the sorting is done in descending order.\n- **Return Type**: The function returns a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a word and its corresponding count.\n\nThis function will work well for counting and sorting the most common words in a given list.", "requirement": "Annotation Coverage"}

If we reach a point where it's impossible to place a character without violating the rule, we backtrack.\n3. **Backtracking for All Solutions**: To find all possible valid rearrangements, we'll need to implement a backtracking algorithm that tries every possible permutation that meets the criteria.\n\nHere\u2019s a Python implementation of the `rearrange_string` function that addresses these requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef rearrange_string(s):\n    # Count the frequency of each character\n    char_count = Counter(s)\n    \n    # Sort characters by their frequency (descending order)\n    sorted_chars = sorted(char_count.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])\n    \n    # Helper function to perform backtracking\n    def backtrack(path, remaining_chars):\n        # If there are no more characters to place, we found a valid arrangement\n        if not remaining_chars:\n            result.append(''.join(path))\n            return\n        \n        # Try to place each character\n        for char, count in remaining_chars:\n            # If the last character in path is the same as the current character, skip it\n            if path and path[-1] == char:\n                continue\n            \n            # Place the character\n            path.append(char)\n            new_remaining = list(remaining_chars)\n            new_remaining.remove((char, count))\n            \n            # If there's still a count left, decrement it\n            if count > 1:\n                new_remaining.append((char, count - 1))\n            \n            # Recur with the updated state\n            backtrack(path, new_remaining)\n            \n            # Backtrack: remove the character from the path\n            path.pop()\n    \n    result = []\n    backtrack([], sorted_chars)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nprint(rearrange_string(\"aab\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Frequency Counting**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.\n\n2. **Sorting**: Characters are sorted based on their frequency in descending order. This helps in placing the most frequent characters first, which increases the chances of finding a valid arrangement quickly.\n\n3. **Backtracking Function**:\n   - `backtrack` is a recursive function that tries to build a valid arrangement.\n   - It checks if the current arrangement is complete (`if not remaining_chars`). If so, it adds the current arrangement to the result list.\n   - For each character in the remaining list, it skips adding the character if it would violate the condition of having no two identical adjacent characters.\n   - It places the character, recurses, and then removes the character to explore other possibilities (backtracking).\n\n4. **Result Collection**: The `result` list collects all valid arrangements found during the backtracking process.\n\nThis solution ensures that we explore all possible valid permutations of the input string while adhering to the constraint of no two identical adjacent characters.", "requirement": "Functionality Extension"}
