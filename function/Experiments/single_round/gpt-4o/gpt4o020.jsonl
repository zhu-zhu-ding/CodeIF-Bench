This is done by iterating over each sublist and then over each item in the sublist.\n\n3. **Counting Frequencies**:\n   - The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each element in the flattened list.\n\n4. **Return Value**:\n   - The function returns a `Counter` object, which is a dictionary subclass where keys are elements and values are their respective counts.\n\nThis implementation efficiently counts the frequency of elements in a list of lists and handles invalid input gracefully by raising an appropriate exception.", "requirement": "Exception Handling"}

In binary representation, bit positions are typically indexed starting from 0 (rightmost bit) to n-1 (leftmost bit), where n is the number of bits. Odd bit positions are 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\nTo set all odd bits, we can create a bitmask where all odd positions are set to 1. We then use the bitwise OR operation to set these bits in the given number.\n\nHere's a Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef odd_bit_set_number(n):\n    # Create a bitmask with all odd bits set\n    # For a 32-bit integer, the bitmask would be: 0b01010101010101010101010101010101\n    # This is equivalent to 0x55555555 in hexadecimal\n    bitmask = 0x55555555\n    \n    # Use bitwise OR to set the odd bits in the number\n    result = n | bitmask\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 42  # Binary: 101010\nresult = odd_bit_set_number(number)\nprint(f\"Original number: {number} (Binary: {bin(number)})\")\nprint(f\"Number with odd bits set: {result} (Binary: {bin(result)})\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Bitmask Creation**: The bitmask `0x55555555` is used for a 32-bit integer, where all odd bits are set to 1. This is represented in binary as `01010101010101010101010101010101`.\n- **Bitwise OR Operation**: The `|` operator is used to set the odd bits of the input number `n` by combining it with the bitmask. This operation ensures that all odd bits in the result are set to 1, regardless of their original state in `n`.\n\nThis function assumes a 32-bit integer.
