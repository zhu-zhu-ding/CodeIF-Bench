If it is, it returns an empty list.\n2. **Flattening the Dictionary**: It flattens the dictionary values into a single list of words. This is done using a nested list comprehension.\n3. **Counting Frequencies**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each word in the flattened list.\n4. **Finding Most Common Words**: The `most_common()` method of the `Counter` object returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency, sorted by frequency in descending order.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the example dictionary provided, the output would be something like:\n```python\n[('apple', 3), ('banana', 3), ('cherry', 2), ('date', 1)]\n```\nThis indicates that the words \"apple\" and \"banana\" appear most frequently, each appearing 3 times.\n\nYou can modify the function as needed to fit specific requirements or additional constraints.", "requirement": "Edge Case Handling"}

A more efficient way to compute it is using dynamic programming with Pascal's triangle properties.\n\nHere is the Python function `binomial_coeff` that handles the edge cases you mentioned:\n\n```python\ndef binomial_coeff(n, k):\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if k < 0 or n < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store intermediate results\n    C = [0] * (k + 1)\n    C[0] = 1  # Base case\n    \n    # Compute binomial coefficients in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Compute next row of pascal triangle using the previous row\n        j = min(i, k)\n        while j > 0:\n            C[j] += C[j - 1]\n            j -= 1\n    \n    return C[k]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 2))  # Output: 10\nprint(binomial_coeff(10, 3)) # Output: 120\nprint(binomial_coeff(0, 0))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 6))  # Output: 0\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, -1)) # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If \\( k < 0 \\) or \\( n < 0 \\) or \\( k > n \\), the function returns 0 because these are invalid inputs.\n   - If \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = n \\), the function returns 1 because there is exactly one way to choose 0 or all elements from a set.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - We use a list `C` to store the binomial coefficients for each value of \\( k \\) up to the current \\( n \\).\n   - We initialize `C[0]` to 1 because \\(\\binom{n}{0} = 1\\) for any \\( n \\).\n   - We then iterate through each row of Pascal's triangle, updating the coefficients based on the previous row's values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we avoid computing large factorials directly and reduces the risk of integer overflow.", "requirement": "Edge Case Handling"}
{"task_id": 28, "completion": "Certainly! To efficiently compute binomial coefficients for large values of `n` and `k`, we can use the dynamic programming approach with memoization.

Then, it will convert the fraction into its decimal form and extract the nth digit.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_nth_digit(numerator, denominator, n):\n    # Handle negative inputs by taking the absolute value\n    numerator = abs(numerator)\n    denominator = abs(denominator)\n    \n    # Calculate the decimal representation of the fraction\n    fraction = numerator / denominator\n    \n    # Convert the fraction to a string to easily access digits\n    fraction_str = str(fraction)\n    \n    # Check if the fraction is an integer (no decimal part)\n    if '.' not in fraction_str:\n        return \"The fraction is an integer and has no decimal part.\"\n    \n    # Find the position of the decimal point\n    decimal_point_index = fraction_str.index('.')\n    \n    # Adjust n to account for the decimal point\n    n -= decimal_point_index + 1\n    \n    # If n is out of range, return a message\n    if n < 0 or n >= len(fraction_str) - decimal_point_index - 1:\n        return \"The requested digit is out of the range of the decimal part.\"\n    \n    # Extract the nth digit after the decimal point\n    nth_digit = fraction_str[decimal_point_index + n]\n    \n    return nth_digit\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(find_nth_digit(-5, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\nprint(find_nth_digit(10, -4, 1))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_nth_digit(1, 3, 1))   # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Handling Negative Inputs**: We take the absolute values of the numerator and denominator to ensure the fraction is positive.\n2. **Fraction Calculation**: We calculate the decimal representation of the fraction.\n3. **String Conversion**: We convert the fraction to a string to easily access individual digits.\n4. **Decimal Point Handling**: We locate the position of the decimal point and adjust `n` to account for it.\n5. **Range Check**: We check if `n` is within the valid range of the decimal part.\n6. **Digit Extraction**: We extract the nth digit from the decimal part of the fraction.\n\nThis function should work for both positive and negative numerators and denominators, as well as handle cases where the fraction is an integer (i.e., no decimal part).", "requirement": "Functionality Extension"}

If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is less than or equal to `k`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.\n- **Result**: The result is the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the length of the longest subsequence meeting the criteria.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired subsequence length with a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\).", "requirement": "Annotation Coverage"}
{"task_id": 60, "completion": "Certainly! Below is a Python function named `max_len_sub` that finds the maximum length of a subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is at most 1. The function follows PEP 8 guidelines for code style.\n\n```python\ndef max_len_sub(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum length of a subsequence in the given array where the difference\n    between adjacent elements is at most 1.\n\n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The maximum length of the subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [1] * n  # Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is a subsequence of length 1\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= 1:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n\n    return max(dp)\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nprint(max_len_sub(arr))  # Output: 5\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of the subsequence ending at index `i`.\n- **Nested Loops**: We use two nested loops to compare each pair of elements in the array. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is at most 1, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.\n- **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the longest subsequence meeting the criteria.\n\nThis function ensures that the differences between adjacent elements in the subsequence are at most 1, and it efficiently computes the desired result using dynamic programming.", "requirement": "Code Standard"}
