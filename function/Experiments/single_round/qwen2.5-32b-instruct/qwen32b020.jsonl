A more efficient way is to compute the binomial coefficient iteratively, which also helps in handling edge cases properly.\n\nHere's a Python function `binomial_coeff` that calculates the binomial coefficient and handles the specified edge cases:\n\n```python\ndef binomial_coeff(n, k):\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize result\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Calculate value iteratively to avoid overflow\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        result *= (n - i + 1)\n        result //= i\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 2))  # Output: 10\nprint(binomial_coeff(0, 0))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 0))  # Output: 1\nprint(binomial_coeff(5, 5))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Edge Cases Handling**:\n  - If \\( k < 0 \\) or \\( n < 0 \\), the function returns 0 because negative values are not valid for binomial coefficients.\n  - If \\( k > n \\), it also returns 0 because you cannot choose more elements than are available.\n  - If \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = n \\), the function returns 1 since there is exactly one way to choose no elements or all elements.\n\n- **Efficient Calculation**:\n  - The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the binomial coefficient. This method avoids calculating large factorials directly, thus preventing potential overflow issues.\n  - The loop runs from 1 to \\( k \\) and multiplies the current result by `(n - i + 1)` and then divides by `i`. This ensures that the intermediate results stay manageable.\n\nThis function should work efficiently and correctly for a wide range of inputs.", "requirement": "Edge Case Handling"}
{"task_id": 28, "completion": "Certainly! To efficiently compute the binomial coefficient for large values of `n` and `k`, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

This prevents redundant calculations.\n   \n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - If `k` is `0` or `k` equals `n`, the binomial coefficient is `1`. This is because there is exactly one way to choose no elements or all elements from a set.\n   \n3. **Recursive Calculation**: The function `calculate_binomial` uses the recursive relation `C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)` to compute the binomial coefficient. Before computing, it checks if the result is already stored in the `dp` table.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: By using memoization, the function avoids recalculating the same values multiple times, making it much more efficient for large values of `n` and `k`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function handles large values efficiently while keeping the code clean and easy to understand.", "requirement": "Functionality Extension"}

Combine the sorted lists, with integers first followed by strings (or vice versa, depending on the requirement).\n\nBelow is the implementation of the `sort_mixed_list` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef sort_mixed_list(mixed_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    # Separate integers and strings\n    integers = [item for item in mixed_list if isinstance(item, int)]\n    strings = [item for item in mixed_list if isinstance(item, str)]\n    \n    # Sort the separate lists\n    integers.sort()\n    strings.sort()\n    \n    # Combine the sorted lists\n    sorted_list = integers + strings\n    \n    return sorted_list\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_list = [34, \"apple\", 67, \"banana\", 56, \"cherry\"]\nsorted_example_list = sort_mixed_list(example_list)\nprint(sorted_example_list)  # Output: [34, 56, 67, 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use list comprehensions to filter out integers and strings from the input list.\n- Each filtered list is sorted using the `.sort()` method.\n- Finally, we concatenate the sorted integer list with the sorted string list and return the result.\n\nThis function ensures that the integers and strings are sorted separately and combined in a way that makes sense, avoiding comparison errors between different data types.", "requirement": "Annotation Coverage"}

This is because setting all odd bits of `0` would result in a number with only the first bit set, which is `1`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef odd_bit_set_number(n):\n    # Handle the edge case for input 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize a variable to hold the mask of all odd bits set to 1.\n    mask = 0\n    \n    # Determine the maximum number of bits needed based on the input number\n    max_bits = n.bit_length()\n    \n    # Construct the mask by setting bits at odd positions\n    for i in range(1, max_bits + 1, 2):  # Start from 1 to ensure odd indices\n        mask |= (1 << i)\n    \n    # Apply the mask to the input number using bitwise OR operation\n    result = n | mask\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(odd_bit_set_number(0))  # Should return 1\nprint(odd_bit_set_number(10)) # Example output for another number\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function starts by checking if the input number `n` is `0`. If so, it returns `1`.\n- A `mask` variable is initialized to `0`. This will be used to set all the odd bits.\n- The loop iterates over the possible bit positions starting from `1` (the second bit, since we start counting from `0`). For each odd position, a `1` is placed in that position using the left shift operator (`<<`) and then added to the `mask` using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).\n- Finally, the function applies the `mask` to the original number `n` using the bitwise OR operator, ensuring that all odd bits are set to `1`.\n- The function then returns the modified number.\n\nThis approach ensures that all odd bits are set regardless of the size of the input number, while also handling the special case where the input is `0`.", "requirement": "Edge Case Handling"}

The difference can be positive or negative, but it should remain the same throughout the subsequence.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `max_len_sub` function:\n\n```python\ndef max_len_sub(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Dictionary to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference.\n    dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]\n    max_length = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            diff = arr[i] - arr[j]\n            # Update the length of the subsequence ending at index i with the current difference.\n            if diff in dp[j]:\n                dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i].get(diff, 1), dp[j][diff] + 1)\n            else:\n                dp[i][diff] = 2  # Start a new subsequence with the current difference\n            max_length = max(max_length, dp[i][diff])\n\n    return max_length\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 5, 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1]\nprint(max_len_sub(arr))  # Output will depend on the input array\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a list `dp` where each element is a dictionary that stores the lengths of subsequences ending at that index with different differences.\n- **Iterate through the array**: For each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`, calculate the difference `diff` between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.\n- **Update the DP table**: If the difference already exists in the dictionary at index `j`, then update the dictionary at index `i` with the length of the subsequence plus one. Otherwise, start a new subsequence with length 2.\n- **Track the maximum length**: Keep track of the maximum length of any subsequence found during the iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider both positive and negative differences, and it efficiently finds the longest subsequence with a consistent difference.", "requirement": "Functionality Extension"}

To solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsequence in the given array where the difference between adjacent elements is constant and equal to the provided integer.

It iterates through the array and updates the dictionary `dp` with the length of the longest subsequence ending at each number. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the dictionary, which represents the length of the longest subsequence with the specified difference.", "requirement": "Annotation Coverage"}
{"task_id": 60, "completion": "Sure, I'll write a Python function named `max_len_sub` that takes an array (list) as input and returns the maximum length of a subsequence where the difference between any two adjacent elements in the subsequence is constant.
