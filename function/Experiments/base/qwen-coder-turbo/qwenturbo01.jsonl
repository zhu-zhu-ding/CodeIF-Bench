If there was a previous character that couldn't be placed yet (because it still had remaining occurrences), we push it back into the heap.\n4. **Check Feasibility**: If at any point the heap is empty but there are remaining occurrences of a character, it means it's impossible to rearrange the string to meet the criteria, so we return an empty string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always try to place the most frequent character available, which helps in avoiding adjacent duplicates."}

Then, it calculates the nth octagonal number using the given formula and returns the result.\n\nYou can test this function with different values of `n` to see the corresponding octagonal numbers."}
{"task_id": 60, "completion": "Sure! Below is a Python function `max_len_sub` that finds the maximum length of the subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is at most 1.\n\n```python\ndef max_len_sub(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [1] * n  # Initialize DP array with 1s since the minimum length of any subsequence is 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= 1:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    \n    return max(dp)\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(max_len_sub(arr))  # Output: 5\n\narr = [4, 3, 5, 2, 1]\nprint(max_len_sub(arr))  # Output: 5\n\narr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nprint(max_len_sub(arr))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `dp` of the same length as the input array `arr`, where each element is set to 1. This is because the minimum length of any subsequence (containing just one element) is 1.\n   \n2. **Nested Loops**: We use two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i > j`. For each pair, we check if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is less than or equal to 1.\n\n3. **Updating DP Array**: If the condition is satisfied, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This ensures that `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i`.\n\n4. **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is at most 1.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), which is efficient enough for moderate-sized arrays."}
