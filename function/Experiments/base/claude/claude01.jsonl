Takes two parameters: `string` (the input string) and `char` (the character to remove)\n2. Handles edge cases (empty string or character)\n3.

First, we check if the string is empty. If it is, we return 0.\n2. We get the length of the string and initialize a counter.\n3. We use nested loops to consider every possible substring:\n   - Outer loop `i` represents the start position\n   - Inner loop `j` represents the end position\n4. For each substring (from index i to j), we check if the first character (s[i]) equals the last character (s[j]).\n5. If they match, we increment our counter.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(count_substring_with_equal_ends(\"abcab\"))  # Output: 7\nprint(count_substring_with_equal_ends(\"aba\"))    # Output: 4\nprint(count_substring_with_equal_ends(\"\"))       # Output: 0\n```\n\nFor the string \"abcab\", the substrings with same first and last characters are:\n- \"a\" (2 times)\n- \"b\" (2 times)\n- \"c\"\n- \"abcab\"\n- \"bcab\"\n\nTotal count: 7\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n\u00b2) where n is the length of the string."}

We use `Counter` from collections module to count the frequency of each number in the input list\n2. We use a min heap (using heapq) to maintain the k most frequent elements\n3.

Here's a clean implementation:\n\n```python\ndef filter_evennumbers(numbers):\n    return list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n```\n\nLet me explain how this works:\n\n1. The function takes a single parameter `numbers` which should be an iterable (like a list) containing numbers\n2. We use the built-in `filter()` function which takes two arguments:\n   - First argument is a lambda function `lambda x: x % 2 == 0` that returns True for even numbers\n   - Second argument is our input sequence `numbers`\n3. The `filter()` function returns a filter object, so we wrap it with `list()` to convert it to a list\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```python\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = filter_evennumbers(numbers)\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nThis solution is concise, readable, and follows Python best practices by using functional programming concepts with the lambda function."}

Here's an efficient solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_num(digits):\n    # Convert digits to strings and sort in descending order\n    digits_str = [str(d) for d in digits]\n    digits_str.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Join the sorted digits to form the largest number\n    return int(''.join(digits_str))\n```\n\nThis solution:\n1. Takes a list of digits as input\n2. Converts each digit to a string (so we can join them later)\n3. Sorts the digits in descending order\n4. Joins the sorted digits together and converts back to an integer\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(find_max_num([1, 2, 3, 4]))      # Output: 4321\nprint(find_max_num([5, 0, 9, 0, 3]))   # Output: 95300\nprint(find_max_num([1, 1, 1]))         # Output: 111\n```\n\nThe function is simple but effective, with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. It handles:\n- Multiple digits\n- Repeated digits\n- Leading zeros (they'll automatically be placed at the end)\n- Single digits\n\nWould you like me to add any additional features or handle any specific edge cases?"}
{"task_id": 58, "completion": "I'll help you create a function to check if two integers have opposite signs. Here's a solution:\n\n```python\ndef opposite_signs(num1: int, num2: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two integers have opposite signs.\n    \n    Args:\n        num1 (int): First integer\n        num2 (int): Second integer\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if numbers have opposite signs, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    return (num1 * num2) < 0\n```\n\nThis solution:\n1. Takes two integer parameters\n2. Uses type hints for better code readability\n3. Includes a docstring explaining the function's purpose\n4. Returns a boolean value\n\nThe logic works by:\n- Multiplying the two numbers together\n- If the result is negative, it means the numbers have opposite signs\n- If the result is positive or zero, the numbers have the same sign (or one/both are zero)\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```python\n# Example usage:\nprint(opposite_signs(1, -2))    # True\nprint(opposite_signs(-3, -4))   # False\nprint(opposite_signs(5, 6))     # False\nprint(opposite_signs(-7, 8))    # True\nprint(opposite_signs(0, 9))     # False\n```\n\nNote that this solution considers zero as having the same sign as both positive and negative numbers, which is a common convention. If you need different behavior with zero, we can modify the function accordingly."}

First, we handle edge cases:\n   - If the array is empty or has only one element, we return its length\n\n2. The main algorithm uses dynamic programming:\n   - We create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index i\n   - Initially, all elements in `dp` are set to 1 (as single elements are valid subsequences)\n\n3. For each position i:\n   - We look at all previous positions j\n   - If the absolute difference between elements at i and j is 1, we can extend the subsequence\n   - We update dp[i] with the maximum possible length\n\n4. Finally, we return the maximum length found\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(max_len_sub([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 5\nprint(max_len_sub([1, 3, 2, 4]))     # Output: 3\nprint(max_len_sub([2, 2, 2, 2]))     # Output: 1\n```\n\nThe time complexity is O(n\u00b2) where n is the length of the input array.\nThe space complexity is O(n) for the dp array.\n\nThis solution will find the longest subsequence where the difference between any two adjacent elements in the subsequence is exactly 1."}
