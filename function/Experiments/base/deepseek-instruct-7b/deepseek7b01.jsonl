The `sorted` function uses a lambda function as the key to sort the matrix. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the matrix.

{"task_id": 54, "completion": "Sure, here is a simple implementation of the counting sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef counting_sort(arr):\n    # Find the maximum element in the array\n    max_val = max(arr)\n    \n    # Initialize the count array with all zeros\n    count = [0] * (max_val + 1)\n    \n    # Store the count of each element in the count array\n    for num in arr:\n        count[num] += 1\n    \n    # Store the cumulative count\n    for i in range(1, len(count)):\n        count[i] += count[i - 1]\n    \n    # Build the output array\n    output = [0] * len(arr)\n    for num in arr:\n        output[count[num] - 1] = num\n        count[num] -= 1\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the maximum value in the input array, then creating a count array of size `max_val + 1` and filling it with the counts of each value in the input array. It then creates a cumulative count array, and finally builds the output array by placing each element in its correct position in the output array.\n\nPlease note that this function sorts the array in-place, meaning that it modifies the input array. If you want to keep the original array unchanged, you should create a copy of the array before calling the function.\n\nAlso, counting sort is not a comparison-based sorting algorithm, so it is not suitable for arrays with negative values or floating-point numbers.\n"}
{"task_id": 55, "completion": "Sure, I can help you with that. A geometric series is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the ratio.\n\nHere's a simple Python function that calculates the nth term of a geometric series:\n\n```python\ndef tn_gp(a, r, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the nth term of a geometric series.\n    a: first term of the series\n    r: common ratio of the series\n    n: term number to calculate\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * r ** (n - 1)\n```\n\nIn this function, `a` is the first term of the series, `r` is the common ratio, and `n` is the term number you want to calculate. The function returns the nth term of the series.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(tn_gp(2, 3, 5))  # Output: 162\n```\n\nThis will calculate the 5th term of the geometric series where the first term is 2 and the common ratio is 3.\n"}

It then checks if the original number is one less than twice its reverse.\n\nFor example, if you call `check(123)`, it will return `True` because 123 is one less than twice its reverse (321). If you call `check(124)`, it will return `False` because 124 is not one less than twice its reverse (421).\n"}
{"task_id": 57, "completion": "Sure, here is a Python function that can be used to find the largest number that can be formed with the given digits. This function uses the `sorted` function to sort the digits in descending order, which will result in the largest number.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_num(digits):\n    return int(''.join(map(str, sorted(digits, reverse=True))))\n```\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(find_max_num([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 321\nprint(find_max_num([5, 5, 5]))  # Output: 555\nprint(find_max_num([9, 8, 7, 6]))  # Output: 9876\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input is a list of integers. If the input is a different type, you may need to modify the function to handle that type correctly.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If you need to handle that case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_num(digits):\n    if not digits:\n        return None\n    return int(''.join(map(str, sorted(digits, reverse=True))))\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the function, if the input list is empty, the function will return `None`.\n"}
{"task_id": 58, "completion": "Here is a simple Python function that checks if two integers have opposite signs:\n\n```python\ndef opposite_signs(num1, num2):\n    return (num1 > 0) != (num2 > 0)\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if the two numbers are greater than 0. If one is greater than 0 and the other is not, then they have opposite signs, so the function returns `True`. If both are greater than 0, or both are not greater than 0, then they do not have opposite signs, so the function returns `False`.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```python\nprint(opposite_signs(1, -1))  # True\nprint(opposite_signs(-1, -1))  # False\nprint(opposite_signs(1, 1))  # False\n```\n\nIn the first example, `1` and `-1` have opposite signs, so the function returns `True`. In the second and third examples, both numbers are positive or both numbers are negative, so they do not have opposite signs, so the function returns `False`.\n"}
{"task_id": 59, "completion": "An octagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the octagon.

The function uses integer division (//) to ensure that the result is an integer.\n\nYou can use this function to find the nth octagonal number like this:\n\n```python\nprint(is_octagonal(1))  # Output: 1\nprint(is_octagonal(2))  # Output: 14\nprint(is_octagonal(3))  # Output: 35\n```\n\nNote: The function is named 'is_octagonal' because in Python, it's common to name functions based on what they do, not what they return. In this case, the function is checking if a number is octagonal, but it always returns True because it's impossible to check if a number is octagonal without knowing its value. If you want to check if a number is octagonal, you should use a different function.\n"}
{"task_id": 60, "completion": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef max_len_sub(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [1]*n\n    for i in range (1 , n):\n        for j in range(0 , i):\n            if arr[i] >= arr[j] and dp[i] < dp[j] + 1:\n                dp[i] = dp[j]+1\n    return max(dp)\n```\n\nThis function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a list `dp` of the same length as the input list, where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i`. It then iterates over the list, and for each element, it checks all previous elements. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element and the length of the longest subsequence ending at the previous element plus one is greater than the current length of the longest subsequence ending at the current element, it updates the current length of the longest subsequence ending at the current element. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `dp`, which is the length of the longest subsequence with difference between adjacent elements.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty and that all elements in the input list are integers.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n\n```python\nprint(max_len_sub([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4\nprint(max_len_sub([5, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4\nprint(max_len_sub([10, 9, 8, 7, 6]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nIn the first example, the longest subsequence with difference between adjacent elements is [1, 2, 3, 4], so the function returns 4. In the second example, the longest subsequence with difference between adjacent elements is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], so the function returns 4. In the third example, there is no subsequence with difference between adjacent elements, so the function returns 1.\n"}
