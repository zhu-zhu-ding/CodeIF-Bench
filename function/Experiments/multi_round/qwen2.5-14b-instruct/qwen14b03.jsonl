This function internally handles the conversion from binary to decimal.\n- The function returns the decimal equivalent directly using `int(binary_str, 2)`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that there is only one path through the code, thus maintaining a cyclomatic complexity of 1."}

This way, we can clearly inform the caller about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nHere's the updated implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef div_even_odd(list1: List[int]) -> Tuple[float, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Divides the first even number by the first odd number in the given list.\n    \n    :param list1: List of integers.\n    :return: A tuple containing the division result (float) and a status code (int).\n             Status code: \n               - 0: Success\n               - 1: No even number found\n               - 2: No odd number found\n               - 3: Division by zero error\n    \"\"\"\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    for num in list1:\n        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:\n            first_even = num\n        elif first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:\n            first_odd = num\n        \n        # Once both first even and first odd are found, break the loop\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Determine the status code based on the presence of even and odd numbers\n    if first_even is None and first_odd is None:\n        return 0.0, 3  # Both missing, unlikely due to logic but covered for completeness\n    elif first_even is None:\n        return 0.0, 1  # Only odd numbers present\n    elif first_odd is None:\n        return 0.0, 2  # Only even numbers present\n    \n    # Perform the division\n    try:\n        result = first_even / first_odd\n        return result, 0  # Success\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        # Handle the case where the first odd number is zero\n        return 0.0, 3  # Division by zero error\n    \n# Example usage:\nresult, status = div_even_odd([5, 3, 2, 8])\nif status == 0:\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Operation failed with status:\", status)\n\nresult, status = div_even_odd([2, 4, 6])\nprint(\"Operation failed with status:\" if status != 0 else \"Result:\", status or result)\n\nresult, status = div_even_odd([1, 3, 5])\nprint(\"Operation failed with status:\" if status != 0 else \"Result:\", status or result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function now includes type annotations for the parameter `list1` and the return type (`Tuple[float, int]`).\n- We use a status code system to indicate the outcome of the operation:\n  - `0`: Operation successful.\n  - `1`: No even number found.\n  - `2`: No odd number found.\n  - `3`: Division by zero error.\n- The function returns a tuple where the first element is the result of the division (or `0.0` in case of failure), and the second element is the status code.\n- Example usages demonstrate how to interpret the returned values and handle different cases.\n\nThis approach provides clear feedback to the caller about what happened during the execution of the function."}

This is because if there is any character whose frequency is too high, it will not be possible to rearrange the string such that no two identical characters are adjacent.\n2. **Edge Case Handling:** If such a condition is met, the function immediately returns an empty string indicating that rearrangement is not possible.\n3. **Character Placement:** We continue to place characters in the result list while ensuring no two adjacent characters are the same.

It takes the current permutation (`current`), the remaining characters (`remaining`), a list to store the results (`result`), and the character count (`char_count`).\n\n3. **Base Case**: When there are no characters left to place (`not remaining`), the current permutation is added to the result list.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each character in `char_count`:\n   - If the character can be placed without violating the adjacency rule (i.e., the last character in `current` is not the same as the character being placed), it is added to `current` and its count is decreased.\n   - The function recursively calls itself with the updated `current`, `remaining`, and `char_count`.\n   - After the recursive call, the character is removed from `current` (backtracking), and its count is restored.\n\n5. **Result Collection**: The `rearrange_string` function collects all valid permutations and ensures they are unique by converting the result list to a set before returning it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we generate all possible valid rearrangements of the string where no two adjacent characters are the same."}

If the item is a list, it calls itself recursively (`yield from flatten(item)`).\n- **freq_element function**: This function uses the `flatten` function to convert the nested list into a flat list and then uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element.\n\n### Example Output:\nGiven the example nested list `[ [1, 2, [3, 4], 5], [6, [7, [8, 9]], 10], [1, 2, 3] ]`, the output would be:\n```\nCounter({1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 1})\n```\n\nThis shows that the numbers 1, 2, and 3 appear twice, while the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 appear once.\n\nThis approach ensures that any level of nesting is handled appropriately, and the function will work correctly regardless of the depth of the nested lists."}

If any element fails this check, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Count Array Initialization**:\n   - The count array is initialized to have a length equal to `max_val + 1` to accommodate all possible values from `0` to `max_val`.\n\n3. **Counting Elements**:\n   - The function increments the count of each element in the count array.\n\n4. **Cumulative Counts**:\n   - The count array is modified to store cumulative counts.\n\n5. **Building the Output Array**:\n   - The sorted array is built by placing each element in its correct position in the output array, based on the count array.\n\nThis ensures that the function strictly adheres to the requirement of accepting only lists of non-negative integers and provides appropriate error messages if the input does not meet these criteria."}

Initially, every single element itself can be considered a subsequence of length 1, so we set all values in `dp` to 1.\n   \n2. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - We iterate through the array starting from the second element (`i = 1`).\n   - For each element `arr[i]`, we check all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`).\n   - If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is exactly `diff`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - Finally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest valid subsequence found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired result with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is feasible for reasonably sized arrays.\n\n### Example:\nFor the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1]`, the longest subsequence with an absolute difference of 1 could be `[1, 2, 1]`, giving us a length of 3.
