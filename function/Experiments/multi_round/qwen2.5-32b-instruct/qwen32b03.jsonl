It then checks if the given number is in the list of Woodall numbers and returns `True` if it is, or returns the list of Woodall numbers otherwise.\n\nThis way, the function can handle both checking if a specific number is a Woodall number and generating a list of all Woodall numbers up to a given number."}

The `isalpha` method checks if a character is an alphabetic letter.\n   - `''.join(...)` is used to convert the filtered result back into a string.\n\n2. **Character Count**:\n   - We create a dictionary `char_count` to keep track of the frequency of each alphabetic character in the filtered string.\n\n3. **Substrings Calculation**:\n   - We iterate over the values in `char_count` and use the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` to calculate the number of substrings that start and end with each character, where `k` is the frequency of the character.\n\n4. **Total Count**:\n   - We accumulate the counts in `total_count` and return it as the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that only substrings starting and ending with alphabetic characters are counted, while ignoring any special characters or spaces."}

If these conditions are not met, a `TypeError` is raised.\n- **Dictionary Usage**: The `dp` dictionary is used to store the length of the longest subsequence ending with each element.
