{"task_id": 60, "requirement": "Functionality Extension", "completion": "To handle cases where the difference between adjacent elements can be negative, we need to clarify the requirement.

It finds the longest subsequence where each pair of adjacent elements either increases or decreases by 1. The function uses a dictionary to track the maximum length of subsequences ending with each element and updates the lengths considering both possibilities (num-1 and num+1)."}
