If so, it returns the list as it is already sorted. If the list has more than one element, it proceeds with the counting sort algorithm.\n\nThe `for num in reversed(arr):` line is used to maintain stability, which means that equal elements appear in the same order in the sorted output as they do in the input array. This is important for sorting tasks where the relative order of equal elements matters.\n\nThe rest of the function remains the same, finding the maximum value, initializing the count array, counting the occurrences, and then building the output array.\n"}

The `min_val` is subtracted from each element before it is counted, and added back when placing the element in the output array, so that the relative order of elements is preserved.\n\nPlease note that the `reversed` function is used when placing elements in the output array to maintain stability, which means that equal elements appear in the same order in both the sorted and original arrays.
