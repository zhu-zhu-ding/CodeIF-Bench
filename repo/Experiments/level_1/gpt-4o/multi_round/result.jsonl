This approach allows us to handle tuples (which are not directly JSON serializable but can be converted to lists) and avoid unnecessary serialization attempts for known non-serializable types like sets and complex numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef is_json_serializable(val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the input value is JSON serializable.\n\n    :param val: Any.

If so, it returns `True`.\n- For lists and tuples, the function checks if all elements are JSON serializable by recursively calling `is_json_serializable` on each element.\n- For dictionaries, the function ensures that all keys are strings (as required by JSON) and that all values are JSON serializable.\n- If the value does not match any of these conditions, the function returns `False`, indicating that the value is not JSON serializable."

This ensures that the function does not raise any unexpected errors when checking for JSON serializability. \n\nHere's the function again, with a bit more explanation on handling exceptions:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef is_json_serializable(val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the input value is JSON serializable.\n\n    :param val: Any.

This prevents the function from crashing and allows it to return `False` instead.\n- **Specific Exceptions**: The function specifically catches `TypeError` and `OverflowError`, which are the exceptions typically raised by `json.dumps()` when it encounters non-serializable data types or values that are too large.\n- **Robustness**: By catching these exceptions, the function is robust and can handle a wide range of input values without raising unexpected errors. \n\nThis approach ensures that the function behaves predictably and safely across different types of input."

For any other unexpected exceptions, it raises a `ValueError` with a generic error message.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function behaves as specified, raising appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs and conversion failures."

This prevents SQL injection and handles special characters correctly.\n- **Error Handling**: The function includes a try-except block to catch and handle any potential database errors gracefully. This is particularly useful for debugging and ensuring that the function doesn't fail silently.\n- **Cursor Management**: The `finally` block ensures that the cursor is closed after the operation, which is a good practice to release database resources.\n\nThis implementation should work well for SQLite databases.

For example:\n   - `i` for integers (supports zero and negative values).\n   - `f` for floats.\n   - `h` for short integers, etc.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: The function includes a try-except block to catch `struct.error` exceptions. This can occur if there is a mismatch between the format string and the provided arguments. The error is re-raised as a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: The `struct` module naturally handles zero and negative numbers for signed types (e.g., `i` for signed integers). Ensure that the format string uses signed types where negative numbers are expected.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the `pack` function should handle edge cases effectively, including packing zero and negative numbers."

The function I provided in the previous response already accommodates this requirement. However, to ensure clarity and demonstrate how floating-point numbers are handled, I'll provide a more detailed explanation and example.\n\nHere's the `pack` function with an example that specifically highlights the packing of floating-point numbers:\n\n```python\nimport struct\n\ndef pack(fmt, *args):\n    \"\"\"\n    Packs the input arguments into a binary string according to the given format.\n\n    :param fmt: String.

The `>` character ensures big-endian byte order.\n\n- **Floating-Point Support**: The `'f'` format character is used to specify a 4-byte (32-bit) floating-point number, which corresponds to a C `float`.\n\n- **Example**: In the example, the integer `42` and the floating-point number `3.14` are packed into a binary string. The resulting binary string can be used for various purposes, such as writing to a binary file or sending over a network.\n\nThis function should meet your requirements for packing floating-point numbers using the `'f'` format character.

If it does, we break out of the loop.\n\n4. **Yielding Slots**: The function yields slot names as before, but now it respects the specified depth limit.\n\nThis implementation allows you to control how far up the inheritance chain you want to collect slots, providing flexibility in how the function is used."

This eliminates the need for an explicit `None` check, reducing one decision point.\n\n2. **Handling `__slots__`**: The check for whether `slots` is a string remains, as it is necessary to handle the case where `__slots__` is defined as a single string.

We can achieve this by checking if the callable is a method of a class or if it is defined within a class context.\n\nHere's an improved version of the `is_inside_class` function:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\n\ndef is_inside_class(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine whether a given callable is defined within a class.\n\n    :param func: Callable. The function to be checked.\n    :return: Bool. True if the function is defined inside a class, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the callable has a __qualname__ attribute\n    if not hasattr(func, '__qualname__'):\n        return False\n    \n    # Get the qualified name and split it by dots\n    qualname_parts = func.__qualname__.split('.')\n    \n    # Inspect the outer frames to find the class context\n    for frame_info in inspect.stack():\n        # Get the local variables in the current frame\n        local_vars = frame_info.frame.f_locals\n        \n        # Check if any local variable is a class and matches the qualname parts\n        for var_name, var_value in local_vars.items():\n            if inspect.isclass(var_value) and var_name in qualname_parts:\n                return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nclass MyClass:\n    def method(self):\n        pass\n\n    class NestedClass:\n        def nested_method(self):\n            pass\n\ndef standalone_function():\n    pass\n\nprint(is_inside_class(MyClass.method))  # True\nprint(is_inside_class(MyClass.NestedClass.nested_method))  # True\nprint(is_inside_class(standalone_function))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first checks if the callable has a `__qualname__` attribute.\n- It splits the `__qualname__` by dots to get the different parts of the qualified name.\n- It uses the `inspect` module to examine the call stack and look for class definitions in the local variables of each frame.\n- If any local variable is a class and its name matches any part of the `qualname`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the callable is defined within a class.\n- This approach is more robust and can handle nested classes and functions by examining the context in which the callable is defined."

Below is the updated `make_artifact_name_safe` function that includes a type check to raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef make_artifact_name_safe(name: str) -> str:\n    # Check if the input is a string\n    if not isinstance(name, str):\n        raise TypeError('Input must be a string')\n    \n    # Replace any character that is not alphanumeric, dash, underscore, or dot with an underscore\n    safe_name = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]', '_', name)\n    \n    # If the length of the cleaned name is greater than 128, truncate it with dots in the middle\n    if len(safe_name) > 128:\n        # Calculate the number of characters to keep on each side\n        keep_length = 64\n        safe_name = safe_name[:keep_length] + '...' + safe_name[-keep_length:]\n    \n    return safe_name\n\n# Example usage:\n# original_name = \"This is a very long artifact name with special characters!@#$%^&*() that needs to be cleaned and truncated if necessary.\"\n# safe_name = make_artifact_name_safe(original_name)\n# print(safe_name)\n```\n\n### Key Addition:\n- **Type Check**: Before processing the input, the function checks if `name` is an instance of `str`. If not, it raises a `TypeError` with the message `'Input must be a string'`. This ensures that the function only processes string inputs, as required."
