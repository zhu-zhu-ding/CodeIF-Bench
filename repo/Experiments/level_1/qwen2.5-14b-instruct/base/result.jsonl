If it's `None` (no host present) or it can be encoded in ASCII without raising an error, the URL remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Convert to IDN Notation:** If the hostname needs conversion, we use `idna.encode()` to transform it into its ACE representation and decode it back to a UTF-8 string.\n\n4. **Rebuild the URL:** We use `urlunparse` method to reconstruct the full URL with the converted hostname.\n\n5. **Catch Exceptions:** The function catches any `IDNAError` that might occur during the conversion process and raises a more user-friendly `ValueError`.\n\nThis function ensures that URLs containing non-ASCII characters in their domain names are properly converted to IDN notation when needed."

The use of `*args` allows for variable-length argument lists, which can be directly passed into the `struct.pack()` function.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- The format characters used in `fmt` must match the types and ordering of the values in `args`. For example, if your format string includes `f` for floats, ensure you pass float values in `args`.\n- The endianness of the output depends on the system's byte order. If cross-platform compatibility is needed, consider using explicit endianness specifiers such as `@` (native) or `<`, `>`, `=`, or `!` (little-endian, big-endian, native, network).\n  \nThis implementation provides a versatile way to handle binary data packing, which is essential in many low-level programming tasks such as network protocol implementations, file I/O operations, and more."

Since the specific structure or class definition for `Record` wasn't provided, I'll assume it's a simple Python class that can be initialized with a dictionary. Also, `_parse_record` is assumed to be an existing function that parses a single JSON record into a `Record` object (or returns `None` if parsing fails).\n\nHere's how you might implement this:\n\n1. Define the `Record` class.\n2. Implement the `_parse_record` function.\n3. Implement the `parse_records` function.\n\nLet's start by defining the `Record` class and the `_parse_record` function. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume `_parse_record` simply creates a `Record` object with the keys and values directly from the JSON record, or fails with a ValueError, returning `None`.\n\n```python\nclass Record:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\ndef _parse_record(json_record):\n    try:\n        return Record(json_record)\n    except ValueError:\n        return None\n\ndef parse_records(json_records):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a list of JSON records into Record objects, filtering out any None values.\n\n    :param json_records: List.

If the creation fails due to invalid input (like the last item in the `json_records` list), `_parse_record` handles that by returning `None`. The `parse_records` function then filters these `None` values out before returning the list of successfully parsed `Record` objects."

Otherwise, it escapes the byte using a `/` followed by its hexadecimal representation and a `-`.\n\nNote: This implementation provides a simplified version of what IMAP Modified UTF-7 might look like and may not comply with the exact specification of IMAP Modified UTF-7 encoding.\n\nFor a more precise implementation of IMAP Modified UTF-7 encoding, you would need to refer to the official standards documents and possibly implement or find a library that adheres closely to those specifications."
