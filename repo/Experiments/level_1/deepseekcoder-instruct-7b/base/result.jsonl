It then creates a string representing the progress bar, and prints it to the terminal.\n\nThe `\\r` in the `sys.stdout.write` call is used to move the cursor to the start of the line, so that the progress bar is overwritten on each call to the function. The `sys.stdout.flush()` call is used to ensure that the output is immediately displayed.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle cases where the terminal size is smaller than the progress bar. In such cases, the progress bar may be cut off.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle cases where the total file size is unknown. In such cases, the progress bar may not be accurate.\n\nFinally, this function does not handle cases where the total file size is zero. In such cases, the progress bar will be empty, which may be confusing.\n\nYou may want to add additional error checking and handling to make this function more robust.\n"

        "completion": "To implement the 'encode' function, we need to follow the IMAP modified UTF-7 encoding rules. Here's a Python function that does this:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport base64\nfrom typing import Union\n\ndef encode(s: Union[str, bytes]) -> bytes:\n    if isinstance(s, str):\n        s = s.encode('utf-8')\n    \n    # Convert to base64 and remove padding\n    base64_encoded = base64.b64encode(s).rstrip(b'=')\n    \n    # Replace characters that need to be encoded\n    modified_utf7 = re.sub(rb'[\\x00-\\x20\\-{}\\-[\\-\\\\\\]-_]', lambda m: b'-' + bytes([ord(m.group(0)) - 0x20]), base64_encoded)\n    \n    # Add '=' to the end to indicate the end of the string\n    modified_utf7 += b'='\n    \n    return modified_utf7\n\n# Example usage:\nfolder_name = \"Test Folder\"\nencoded_folder_name = encode(folder_name)\nprint(encoded_folder_name)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input is a string and encodes it to bytes if necessary. It then encodes the bytes using base64, which is a common encoding method for binary data. The base64-encoded string is then modified according to the IMAP modified UTF-7 rules. Characters in the range of ASCII 0x20 (space) to ASCII 0x7E (~) are left unchanged, while characters outside this range are encoded by prefixing a hyphen (-) and then adding the ASCII value of the character minus 0x20. The function also adds '=' to the end of the string to indicate the end of the encoded data.\n\nPlease note that the actual IMAP server might require additional steps or different encoding rules, so this function is a basic implementation and might need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the server you are using.\n"

For example:\n\n```python\nversion_info = (2, 0, 0, 'alpha')\nprint(_imapclient_version_string(version_info))  # Output: 2.0.0-alpha\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the version information is provided in the format (major, minor, micro, releaselevel), where `major`, `minor`, and `micro` are integers representing the major, minor, and micro versions respectively, and `releaselevel` is a string representing the release level (e.g., 'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate', 'final').\n"
