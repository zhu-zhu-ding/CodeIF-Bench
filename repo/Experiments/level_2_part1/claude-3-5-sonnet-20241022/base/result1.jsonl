Iterates through all defined properties (`_prop_names`) and:\n   - Skips None values\n   - Recursively converts nested Component instances to JSON\n   - Handles lists/tuples of components by converting each component item to JSON\n   - Adds regular values directly\n\n3. Adds any wildcard properties (those starting with \"data-\" or \"aria-\") to the props dictionary\n\n4. Returns the complete JSON object\n\nThe function handles nested components and collections of components by recursively calling `to_plotly_json` on those components.

If no schema is specified, returns the default version 2 (as indicated in the original code's comment)\n4. Uses regex to extract the version number from the schema URL\n5.
