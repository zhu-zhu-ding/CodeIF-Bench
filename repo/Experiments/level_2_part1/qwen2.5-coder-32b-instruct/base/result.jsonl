This is typically done to avoid adding internal attributes that might not be meant for external use or representation.\n3. **Add Wildcard Properties**: Loop again to specifically include properties that start with `\"data-\"` and `\"aria-\"`. These are assumed to be user-defined attributes that should be included in the JSON output according to the requirements.\n4. **Include Type and Namespace**: Directly add the `_type` and `_namespace` attributes to the JSON object. These are assumed to be standard attributes of the `Component` class and provide crucial information about the component.\n5. **Return JSON Representation**: Convert the dictionary to a JSON string. The `default=str` parameter is used to handle non-serializable objects like sets, custom classes, etc., by converting them to their string representations.\n\nThis function assumes that the `Component` class does not contain any complex non-serializable attributes apart from what has been addressed. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the exact nature and additional requirements of the data within the `Component` instances."

The `$schema` attribute is expected to contain a URL like `https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/vX.X.json`, where `X` represents the major version number. If the pattern does not match, the method returns `2` by default, which is a common practice when dealing with unspecified versions, as Vega-Lite version 2 is often treated as the default version for compatibility reasons.\n\nRemember to import the `re` module at the beginning of your script or file to use regular expressions in Python."
